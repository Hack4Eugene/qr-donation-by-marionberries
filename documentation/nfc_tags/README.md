# NFC Tags (Near Field Communicatons)

NFC tags allow you to load a URL into your browser by just placing your phone close to the tag.

## Writing

The NFC Tags hold the donation page URLs. The easiest way to write the URLs to the tags requires a smart phone with built-in NFC capability and an NFC writer app, such as [NFC Writer by Trigger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tagstand.writer).

In the Trigger NFC app:

- tap the Web Address button
- enter your desired URL
- tap the Write Tag button
- place tag against back of phone
- this should cause the URL to be written to the tag
- exit the app

The phone should now be able to read the tag.

## Usage

- Place your phone against the tag
- Your phone will read the tag and display a dialog box asking you to confirm that you would like open the link in your browser.
- Tap OK and proceed in the normal way of the web.
