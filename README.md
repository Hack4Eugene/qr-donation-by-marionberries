## Team: MarionBerries

This project was developed during the 2018 Hack For a Cause event in Eugene, OR. It addresses the QR Donation challenge submitted by Adam Wendt from the [Eugene/Springfield NAACP](http://naacplanecounty.org/).


## Challenge: Easy Donations

Existing payment scheme was not intuitive to NAACP staff and donors. The Challenge Champion wanted to have a payment method that are:

- Easy to pay through QR or other technnologies
- Specific to five different causes (youth council, general fund, legal redress, ACT-SO, and Maddie Reynolds scholarship)
- Doesn't require login to specific payment scheme for those who don't have accounts, but only their credit card
- Collects donor's information (name, address, email, phone)
