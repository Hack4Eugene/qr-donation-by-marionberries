# Hack For A Cause

## Team: MarionBerries

This project was developed during the 2018 Hack For a Cause event in Eugene, OR. It addresses the QR Donation challenge submitted by Adam Wendt from the [Eugene/Springfield NAACP](http://naacplanecounty.org/).

## Usage

We used the following technologies to implement our solution:

Payment:

- Paypal
- Stripe
- QR Codes
- NFC Tags
- Bluetooth Beacons

## QR Codes

## NFC Tags

### Writing URLs to Tags

The NFC Tags hold the donation page URLs. The easiest way to write the URLs to the tags requires a smart phone with built-in NFC capability and an NFC writer app, such as [NFC Writer by Trigger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tagstand.writer).

In the Trigger NFC app:

- tap the Web Address button
- enter your desired URL
- tap the Write Tag button
- place tag against back of phone
- this should cause the URL to be written to the tag
- exit the app

The phone should now be able to read the tag.

## Bluetooth Beacons

Access points:

- Bluetooth Beacons
